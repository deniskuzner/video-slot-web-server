# Video Slot Web Server

Video Slot game desktop application built with Java.

The player has a limited budget and defines the stake before each game. The game will be considered winning if there is a series of 3 to 5 adjacent columns that contain a field with the same value. Only a row that is on one of the five paylines is accepted and starts from the first column on the left. The paylines are shown in the following figure:

The amount of winnings will be determined based on the length of the series, the value of the corresponding field and the user stake. Gains on different lines are added together.
If the game is winning, the user chooses between two options. The first is to accept the win, and the second is to try to double the amount by guessing the color of the card that will be drawn at random (red / black).
